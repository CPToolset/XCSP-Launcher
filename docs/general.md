## ðŸªµ Logging

You can control the verbosity of the CLI using the `--level` option.  
This feature is powered by the [Loguru](https://github.com/Delgan/loguru) logging library.

Available log levels:

- `TRACE`
- `DEBUG`
- `INFO` (default)
- `SUCCESS`
- `WARNING`
- `ERROR`
- `CRITICAL`

Example:

```bash
xcsp --level DEBUG solver --name ace --instance queens.xml
```

This will output more detailed execution logs (from `xcsp-launcher`) during the run. 
This option not control the verbosity of the solver.
